# ou_tree_list

A simple application to view and modify hierarchical data.
Features:
* hierarchical list view using *ListView builder* and customizable *ListTile*, appropriate for a large number of children;
* navigation into sub-trees
* collapse / expand whole dataset
* use a simple repository interface to interact with a remote datasource
* editable mode
  * drag and drop to move whole sub-trees into different parent nodes
  * node addition
  * sub-tree removal
  * node modification

Data handling is implemented by two components:
* *TreeListView*
* *TreeListButtonBar*
and a data model
* *TreeListModel*

Data must fulfill these requirements:
* The data item must implement the *TreeNode* mixin which defines a set of getter for required properties;
* hierarchical items must follow *breadth first* order; the library expects to receive already ordered data;
* the whole dataset must be loaded;

This application showcase the following flutter features:
* Flutter 2 navigation system
* Null safety
* Provider-based state management
* Localization
