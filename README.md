A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### Quick preface

I'm an absolute beginner. I want to start citing David Bowie to clarify that this article is more 
an exploration than an exploitation of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), the Google's last creature 
for developing client side applications.

### Flutter

First things first, a brief introduction to Flutter itself.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)) told us that Flutter is an open-source 
UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for 
Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Announced in 2015, version 1.0 released in December 2018, version 2.0 just released in March 2021 
with the big announcement for the addition of official support for web-based applications as well 
as early-access desktop application support.

It provides a reactive, declarative UI framework in which the user interface is decoupled from its 
underlying state. The UI description is built using a React-style API, and the framework takes 
care of using it in order to create and update the user interface as appropriate.

#### Architecture

I don't have the ambition to go through all the details and you can find a more accurate overview 
[here](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/architectural-overview), which I'll try to condense in a 
few paragraphs below.

It's composed by three layers:
- *Framework* in [Dart language](https://dart.dev/); it's the interface exposed to the developer, 
with a declarative, reactive-style approach to UI. It can be described as composed by the following layers:
  - foundation: basic functionalities and building block services such as animations, painting and gestures
  - rendering layer: abstraction for layout's handling
  - widgets layer: permits a composition 
  - material and cupertino libraries
